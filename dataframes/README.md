**Input:** "For the text I will input next, output only polymers of the type OMIEC, also known as Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors. Do not output other types of polymers, and other kinds of materials, only the polymers. The output must be only the polymer material names separated by semicolons. Do not repeat the polymer name more than once. Do not output 'OMIEC' or 'OMIEC based', tell me the name of the polymer that is of this type. If no polymer was found, output 'None'"

**Output:** OMIEC_RESPONSES.xlsx
